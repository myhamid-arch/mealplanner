Scope: Plan follow-ups (R-58): drag and keyboard move of a meal between days (UX-4, W-5 addendum), substituted copies whose steps name the substitute (W-6), slot targets that sum to the day target on screen and in the resolver (W-7), and the "Use for <day> <slot>" recipe action deferred from 1.4.5, as specified in docs/spec (see 11-build-plan.md §5 and §8 R-58, W-6, W-7) and matching docs/mockups.

- [x] G1: move: plan_meal.move op and route; both days re-solved; occupied slot exchanges; locked meal or published day refused 409; admin only; undo via change log; drag and keyboard Move menu call it; negative control on unsolved plates

- [x] G6: architect visual review against the Plan mockups and the substituted cook sheet
  EVIDENCE: architect review 2026-09-27 at 1a75f88 merged onto dc61783 (builder's 390/1280 px captures: week grid mid-drag, meal sheet with Move to... and 'of N kcal today', PlatePhone with the day-kind calorie note, RecipePage Use for Wed dinner, cook sheet with the canola oil copy): matches WeekPlan, PlatePhone, RecipePage and CookSheet with the SPEC-Q-2/5/7 additions; the pre-check race (lock landing mid-move gives 422 instead of 409, nothing written) accepted; G1-G5 met twice (DATABASE_URL unset and set, --timeout 1800); mutations caught: substitutedSteps returning steps unchanged (G2, 6 assertions), occupant check removed (G1, locked occupant 409 test). Seen and recorded outside this leaf: W-12
